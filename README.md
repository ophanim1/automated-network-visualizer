# Automated Network Visualizer

This tool scans your local network, identifies connected devices (brand, type, etc.), and visualizes the network topology in your browser via a webserver hosted on `localhost`. It's particularly useful for network administrators and IT professionals who need to quickly understand their network topology.

> **Note: This is a proof of concept project.** While functional, it's primarily intended to demonstrate the concept of automated network visualization and device discovery. The code is provided as-is, with no guarantees of production readiness or ongoing support.

## Features
- Automatic network scanning (finds all devices on your subnet)
- Identifies device manufacturer and type (where possible)
- Attempts to infer network topology
- Interactive visualization in your browser (using vis.js)
- Support for selecting specific network interfaces
- Real-time network device discovery
- Device categorization and grouping
- Exportable network diagrams

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Windows OS
- Administrator privileges (for full network scanning capabilities)
- Required Python packages (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - Flask
  - scapy
  - python-nmap
  - netifaces
  - requests

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-network-visualizer.git
   cd automated-network-visualizer
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script as Administrator:
   ```sh
   # Right-click PowerShell/Command Prompt and select "Run as Administrator"
   python main.py
   ```

2. When prompted, select your network interface:
   - The program will display a list of available network interfaces
   - Choose the interface connected to the network you want to scan
   - For USB Ethernet adapters, look for the interface name containing "USB" or your adapter's name

3. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Network Interface Selection
- The tool will automatically detect all available network interfaces
- Choose the interface that corresponds to your active network connection
- For USB Ethernet adapters, ensure you select the correct interface
- Virtual interfaces (like VirtualBox adapters) should be avoided unless specifically needed

## Troubleshooting
1. **No devices found:**
   - Ensure you're running as Administrator
   - Check if your firewall is blocking the scan
   - Verify you've selected the correct network interface
   - Confirm your network connection is active

2. **Interface selection issues:**
   - If you don't see your USB Ethernet adapter, try:
     - Reconnecting the adapter
     - Updating the adapter drivers
     - Checking Device Manager for any issues

3. **Visualization problems:**
   - Clear your browser cache
   - Try a different browser
   - Check the console for any JavaScript errors

## Notes
- SNMP-based topology inference is limited on most home networks
- For best results, ensure your firewall allows local Python scripts to scan the network
- The tool works best on Windows networks with standard network configurations
- Generated diagrams are stored in the `diagrams/` directory
